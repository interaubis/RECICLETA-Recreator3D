# RECICLETA after TheRecreator3D

<p> Modular 3D printed DIY 3D Printer Filament From Soda Bottles </p>
 <p> The folder Recicleta 2024 contains the stl files for printing. </p>
<p> This version was created for educational purposes, it has both ends fixed on a wood board for structure instead of horizontal bars all along the machine </p>
<p> Created with Chico Simoes in an educational workshop at SESC Avenida Paulista, 2023/2024 </p>

<p> Built upon the Recreator3D. </p>

<p> All stl are better if printed with PETG or PET1 (recycled PET bottles) </p>
